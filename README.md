## Planning 
 Initial idea: 
* [Brainstorming google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNHTZDroEdn7dWCZV7hvGdUV4cpnyijDJrtq9_-6brM/edit?tab=t.ggfqs8b05i7f)

* Project google drive: Add link
* Final presentation: Add link

**Folder Structure**
* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets.
